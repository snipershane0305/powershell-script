put the AutoStart.ps1 file in your "C:\Users\"YOUR USERNAME HERE"\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup"

then put the StartUp.ps1, memreduct.exe, SetTimerResolution.exe, and registry.reg into the "C:\" directory

this will auto start every time you boot into windows, this script sets a bunch of settings and does some maintenance and improves privacy and security.
this may improve some system performance and network performance by setting more performant configurations and adding more overhead in windows but you WONT see big performance impact in GAMES. 
video game performance is more impacted by your specific hardware and clock speeds. consider overclocking/undervolting and better cooling solutions for better performance in GAMES!
